# SkinDiseaseDetectionSystem
Automated skin disease detection using deep learning enhances diagnostic accuracy by addressing challenges posed by diverse dermatological conditions with overlapping symptoms. A convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach is implemented to classify seven prevalent skin diseases: acne, eczema, psoriasis, melanoma, rosacea, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and ringworm. The Skin Disease Data dataset is utilized for training and evaluation, ensuring robust model performance. Pretrained architectures, including VGG16, Xception, NASNetMobile, and a hybrid Xception-NASNetMobile model, are explored for feature extraction and classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the Xception-NASNetMobile fusion achieves superior performance in terms of accuracy and generalization, outperforming individual models. The integration of multiple architectures leverages the strengths of deep feature representation, enhancing classification efficacy in distinguishing subtle dermatological variations. The proposed method provides a reliable, automated diagnostic tool for dermatological assessment, facilitating early detection and improving clinical decision-making. The results underscore the potential of deep learning models in dermatology, contributing to the advancement of AI-driven medical diagnostics and telemedicine applications.
The objective is to develop an automated skin disease detection system using deep learning to accurately classify seven common dermatological conditions. Pretrained convolutional neural networks, including VGG16, Xception, NASNetMobile, and a hybrid Xception-NASNetMobile model, are utilized for feature extraction and classification. Image preprocessing techniques such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation are applied to enhance model robustness. Transfer learning is employed to optimize performance while minimizing computational resources. The system aims to provide an efficient, AI-driven diagnostic tool for dermatology.
