Notebook
-------------

1. Importing the Packages
2. Exploring the Datasets
	- Skin Disease Data
3. Image Data Augmentation
	- Re-scaling the Image
	- Shear Transformation
	- Zooming the Image
	- Horizontal Flip 
	- Reshaping the Image 
4. Function for calculating the Recall, Precision and F1 Score
5. Defining the EarlyStopping to avoid either Under/Over Fitting
6. Calling the Model
	
	- VGG16
	- Xception
	- NASNetMobile
	- Xception + NASNetMobile


7. Building and Training the model  
8. Dumping the best model for classifying the abnormalities further
9. Evaluting the Models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1Score, Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve


FrontEnd
--------

10. Frontend is developed with help of Flask Framework, along with Registration and Login setup with support of Sqlite DB
11. For the frontend we used the data for classifying and detecting
12. User uploads an image
	- Classification
13. The given input is preprocessed for classifying and detecting
14. Trained model is used for classifying and detecting
15. Final outcome is displayed through frontend


Dataset 
--------
